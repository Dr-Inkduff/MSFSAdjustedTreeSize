Add-on to adjust tree sizes in MSFS to more realistic values

The generate script can be used to clone the base file and multiply both min and max values by a ratio

Default ratio is 0.5 but this can be passed in as a command line argument for different values

The options directory contains some pregenerated sizes (0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.2, 1.5, 2) - these can be renamed to 10-asobo_species.xml and moved under the vegetation directory to use those sizes instead

When there is a sim update it is possible that the format of this file could change and these files will no longer be compatible. At this stage the files are compatible with the current sim version - 1.18.15.0
